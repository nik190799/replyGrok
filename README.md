# replyGrok
This is a simple Twitter bot implemented in Python that leverages the OpenAI GPT-4 model to generate responses for Twitter mentions. 
The bot reads mentions, extracts relevant information, and responds with modified text generated by GPT-4.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following modules/libraries installed:

- tweepy
- requests
- openai
- boto3
  
### Install them using:
- pip install tweepy requests openai boto3

## Configuration
Before using the bot, you need to set up your Twitter API keys and OpenAI GPT-4 credentials. Insert your keys and tokens in the designated placeholders in the code.

## python
Credentials (Insert your keys and tokens below)
- api_key = ""
- api_secret = ""
- bearer_token = ""
- access_token = ""
- access_token_secret = ""

## Functions
- xApi()
- - Creates a Tweepy client with the provided credentials.

- extractTextAndUrl(text)
- - Extracts text and URLs from a given tweet.

- get_quote_tweet_id(shortened_url)
- - Expands a shortened URL and returns the quoted tweet's ID.

- get_entire_quoted_tweets(tweet_text)
- - Fetches the entire text of quoted tweets given a tweet text containing URLs.

- gptModifyer(news_text: str)
- - Uses GPT-4 to modify the provided news text and returns the generated response.

- reply()
- - Fetches mentions, processes them, and replies with GPT-4 modified text.

- lambda_handler(event, context)
- - AWS Lambda handler for triggering the bot. Invokes the reply() function.

## Usage
Set up your Twitter API keys and OpenAI GPT-4 credentials.
Install the required modules/libraries.
Run the script, or deploy it as an AWS Lambda function.

### Note
This is a basic implementation, and further customization and error handling can be added based on your specific use case. Make sure to comply with Twitter's API v1.0 & v2.0 usage policies.
